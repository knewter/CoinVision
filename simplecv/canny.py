	Smooth the image, by default with the Gaussian blur. If desired, additional algorithms and aperatures can be specified. Optional parameters are passed directly to OpenCVâ€™s cv.Smooth() function.
If grayscale is true the smoothing operation is only performed on a single channel otherwise the operation is performed on each channel of the image.
